Low back pain
General
Lower back pain is common. As many as 80% of the population will experience lower back pain at least once in their lives. Lower back problems can manifest in various ways. Many people complain of a nagging ache or stiffness, but the pain can also be felt as nerve pain (e.g., radiating to the legs). To understand how back pain develops, we first need to understand the anatomy of the lower back.

Anatomy
The lower back consists of five lumbar vertebrae. Between each vertebra is an intervertebral disc, which acts as a shock absorber. At the back, the vertebrae are connected by two joints, one on the left and one on the right. Several muscles run along the spine, which, among other things, enable us to sit and stand upright, and to move.

The pelvis forms the base upon which the spine rests and supports the body's weight. The pelvis consists of a central triangular portion (the sacrum) that forms a joint on either side with the two hip bones. These joints are held together by strong ligaments called the sacroiliac joints (SI joints).

Complaints
The complaints that arise in the lower back depend on the structure where the problem occurs. The muscles, joints, and intervertebral discs at the level of the lumbar vertebrae can each cause complaints. Although the complaints may seem almost identical, the causes are often different. A proper diagnosis is therefore crucial. Because different causes often require different treatments, sufficient time must be allocated during the examination. A chiropractor is fully trained to identify the correct cause and then treat it accurately.

Causes
Causes of lower back pain or pelvic pain can be divided into gradual and sudden.

Gradual causes
·
Little variation in posture and little movement (as with office work).
·
Incorrect or one-sided loading (such as a heavy bag over one shoulder).
·
The natural aging of the cartilage in the neck (also called osteoarthritis, wear and tear or degeneration).
·
Tension, stress, fatigue, illness, cold, moisture, etc.
·
The changes in hormone levels during pregnancy.
Sudden causes
·
A traffic accident.
·
A wrong movement or twist, such as sweeping or digging, a stooping or twisting movement (for example when lifting something out of the trunk).
