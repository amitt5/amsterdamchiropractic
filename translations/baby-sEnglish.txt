Causes and possible problems in babies
A child experiences a great deal of physical stress during its growth. The first thing a developing spine experiences is the posture it is forced to adopt in the womb.

Many women will have heard that fetal positions, such as breech or transverse, can cause problems during labor. What is often less well known is that such positions also affect the fetus's spine.

Even during a normal delivery, a lot of pressure is exerted on the baby's body. A cesarean section might seem less traumatic, but the opposite is true.

A newborn baby's complaints may be related to irritation of the nervous system due to blockages in the back.

Symptoms in babies
Restless, nervous, crying a lot
Sleep problems / rhythm problems
Preferred position of the head or pelvis
Overstretching
Preferred breast with feeding
Problems with sucking
Grabbing the ears
Asymmetrical shape of the head
Asymmetrical movement of the arms and/or legs
Excessive crying when dressing and undressing
Unstable head control for age
Delayed development
Ear infections
Constipation
Of course, the above complaints can also have other causes. The chiropractor always assesses whether treatment is beneficial.

Excessive crying
As many as 10-15% of all newborn babies cry excessively and are inconsolable. This is often accompanied by pulling up their legs, clenching their fists, and hyperextending.

Crying babies are babies aged 0 to 3 months who cry for at least 3 hours a day, more than 3 days a week, and for more than 3 weeks in a row, usually in the late afternoon or evening.

This excessive crying can be stressful and disrupt the mother-child relationship, impacting it for years to come. Crying is often a sign of pain, for example, due to colic, allergies, or spinal blockages.

It's often said that excessive crying usually goes away on its own around the age of 3 months. Blockages that affect development can still be present, even if they don't seem that way. Therefore, it's advisable to have children older than 3 months examined by a chiropractor, especially if they cried a lot as a young baby.

KISS syndrome
A frequently mentioned problem in children is KISS syndrome (Collision Influence on Symmetry Disturbances). This syndrome encompasses a wide range of symptoms that can occur in babies and children, including excessive crying, positional preference, and hyperextension.

Sometimes it also involves more vague complaints. All these complaints stem from a blockage in the area of ​​the upper cervical vertebrae and the unwanted adaptations the body makes to it.

It is always necessary for the chiropractor to examine the entire body, as neck problems can also be caused by restricted movement in the pelvis.

Ear infection
Frequently grabbing the head and ears with the hands is also something seen in babies. This is often thought to be an ear infection, although it is not necessarily diagnosed.

The motor functions high in the neck play an underlying role in the development of ear infections. Tension on the Eustachian tube in the ear, caused by a blockage in the neck, can hinder the drainage of fluid from the ear, leading to an infection.

By removing the blockage in the neck, the Eustachian tube can drain the ear fluid freely again.

Treatment
Treating children is not the same as treating adults. The physical examination is performed in a playful manner after a thorough interview with the child and parent(s), after which treatment can begin.

The chiropractic adjustments performed are tailored to children and are virtually painless. Children generally recover faster than adults, so treatment frequencies are often lower. However, this depends on the patient's symptoms and the chiropractor will propose a suitable, personalized treatment plan.

Chiropractors have been treating children of all ages for over 100 years. Chiropractic care is highly effective and, above all, very safe for children. The treatment uses gentle pressure techniques to correct blockages and is unlike any other treatment for adults.
