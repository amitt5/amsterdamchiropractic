Children
Causes
Children, just like adults, can develop musculoskeletal problems. This can happen as early as childbirth, but especially in the years that follow, as they grow up with ups and downs.

Falls, accidents, and long hours spent sitting at school and in sports can all lead to symptoms. Children often recover quickly, but if symptoms persist, they should definitely be taken seriously.

Symptoms
Children often can't tell where they're in pain, so it's important to know that this is often indicated by headaches or stomachaches. Behavior can also reveal that a child isn't feeling well, because they're very tired or fidgety, or their sleep habits change.

Reduced resistance can be accompanied by physical complaints, especially when children have underlying conditions such as asthma, frequent throat, nose and ear complaints, as well as scoliosis.

Chiropractic care cannot cure these latter conditions, but its effects on the body can be minimized, allowing a child to grow up as naturally as possible. For example, in children with asthma, we see them primarily breathing through their chests. This can cause increased muscle tension in the shoulder region, accompanied by joint blockages in the upper back, ribs, and neck.

Treatment
Treating children is not the same as treating adults. The physical examination is performed in a playful manner after a thorough interview with the child and parent(s), after which treatment can begin.

The chiropractic adjustments performed are tailored to children and are virtually painless. Children generally recover faster than adults, so treatment frequencies are often lower. However, this depends on the patient's symptoms and the chiropractor will propose a suitable, personalized treatment plan.

Chiropractors have been treating children of all ages for over 100 years. Chiropractic care is highly effective and, above all, very safe for children. The treatment uses gentle pressure techniques to correct blockages and is unlike any other treatment for adults.
