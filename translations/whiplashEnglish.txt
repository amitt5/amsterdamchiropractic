Whiplash
Whiplash is a sudden, quick movement that occurs during a traffic accident or fall. This movement can damage the vertebrae and tissues (muscles, nerves) in the neck. This can result in whiplash trauma: pain, stiffness, and other symptoms that sometimes only manifest months after the accident. Chiropractors have methods available to treat or alleviate whiplash symptoms.

Symptoms
The most common whiplash symptom is a painful, often stiff neck. Many whiplash patients also experience headaches, lower back pain, and radiating pain to the arms and face. However, many other symptoms can be part of the whiplash trauma, such as loss of strength in the arms, dizziness, balance problems, nausea, tinnitus, blurred vision or spots before the eyes, and difficulty sleeping and concentrating. Not only the nature but also the severity of the symptoms vary considerably. Half of patients recover within a month, but sometimes the consequences are so severe that they lead to work disability.

Causes
Whiplash is a well-known, common term often associated with car accidents. In the past, people in train accidents, even with minor impacts, could experience similar symptoms to whiplash; this was called "railway spine." For a long time, this was not recognized, and these "railway spine" victims received no compensation after the accident.

Whiplash is the English word for whiplash; the term refers to the rapid, forced head movement that can lead to the aforementioned symptoms. Whiplash isn't limited to traffic accidents; it can also result from a fall down the stairs or a skiing accident.

Because the body is subjected to significant forces during a rear-end collision, certain parts of the body accelerate differently. This is why a whiplash injury can be so traumatic. First, the torso or lower body, including the shoulders, moves forward, and a few milliseconds later, the head accelerates. This forceful movement can stretch the joint capsules, muscles, tendons, and nerves, resulting in pain and other symptoms.

Treatment
The chiropractor will first ask you questions about your symptoms to get a clear picture of your health. They will also need to determine to what extent the accident caused a whiplash reaction. This will be followed by a thorough physical examination, focusing on joint mobility. If whiplash is present, the chiropractor will determine your degree of whiplash, which represents the severity of your symptoms.

If an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI scan is available or can be requested, this can be helpful for the chiropractor to determine the prognosis and tailor treatment accordingly. The chiropractor may also recommend diagnostic testing. This is done in consultation with your general practitioner or medical specialist.

Depending on the severity of the complaint, the chiropractor can begin treatment. By gently moving the vertebrae using pressure techniques, muscles and nerves can resume normal function. Thanks to the pressure techniques, mobility improves, muscles relax, and surrounding nerves regain the space to perform their functions. This can reduce or eliminate pain and other symptoms. The results of the treatment depend on the severity of the complaint; your chiropractor will keep you updated on your progress.

In addition to treatment, the chiropractor can advise you on good posture, ergonomics, sports, exercises, and nutrition. Exercise is beneficial for both prevention and treatment. Incorrect movement can actually worsen the symptoms. Therefore, it's crucial to seek advice. Developing strong neck muscles is crucial. This will protect your spine and reduce the risk of recurrence.
