Sports injuries
Sports and injuries
Whether you play sports for fun or professionally, every athlete runs the risk of injury. Every year, many Dutch people get injured while playing sports; this is painful and unpleasant for the athlete and expensive for society due to the significant absenteeism caused by the injury.

The body is subjected to heavy loads during exercise, and small imperfections that are not perceived as a nuisance in everyday life, or sometimes not even noticed at all, can cause injuries and negatively impact performance.

Prevention
Many athletes, both recreational and professional, therefore choose to regularly visit a chiropractor and have their bodies checked. This preventative approach has resulted in a dramatic reduction in injuries at a top club like AC Milan. It has also enabled the footballers to perform at a top level well into their later years.

Chiropractic
Chiropractors are uniquely qualified to treat and prevent muscle and joint problems. An optimally functioning musculoskeletal system leads to better performance and fewer injuries! Research and practical experience show that a chiropractor's preventative approach can drastically reduce the number of injuries. It also appears that an active approach after an injury can significantly accelerate rehabilitation.

Acute and chronic
Injuries can occur acutely or chronically. Acutely due to a sudden, incorrect movement, and chronically due to an incorrect movement pattern that may have been established long ago. It is clear that it is advisable to detect and treat these functional disorders as soon as possible.

Symptoms
Reduced performance, minor aches or stiffness, or slow recovery from minor injuries can all point to poorly functioning muscles and joints. Recurring knee or ankle problems may even be caused by an incorrect movement pattern in the lower back or hip.

Treatment of athletes
Athletes require a different approach than non-athletes because the forces acting on an athlete's body are far greater than those we experience in normal daily life. An athlete will therefore need to continue rehabilitation after an injury for longer; being almost pain-free isn't good enough. An athlete will want to return to a higher level than before the injury. A well-functioning body has the right balance of strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination. The athlete then has good control over their body and learns not only their capabilities but also their potential weaknesses.

Before any treatment takes place, there will be an initial consultation and a thorough physical examination. During treatment, the focus is on removing blockages and restoring the mobility of muscles and joints. Your chiropractor uses a variety of techniques for this purpose. They can also advise you on exercises and nutrition, among other things.
