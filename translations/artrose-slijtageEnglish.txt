Osteoarthritis / Wear and tear
Osteoarthritis affects millions of people. Chiropractic care can slow its progression, reduce pain, and improve mobility.

What is osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease in which the cartilage in the joints gradually wears away. It most commonly affects the spine, knees, hips, hands, and feet. As the cartilage thins, bones can rub against each other, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.
